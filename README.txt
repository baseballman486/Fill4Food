First off, I would like to mention I have some experience with HTML CSS and JS. Now, I am not good at any of them and this is why I am asking for your help.

I am working on a project called Fill4Food (More info at Fill4Food.com). Once you are familiar you will understand what I am going for with this webapp.

I am unsure if react or just vanilla fullstack would be better. The concept you see is very incomplete and barely works. Everything I have right now is as a result of ChatGPT.

The interface I want to build would ideally be able to scan some type of RFID card (still TBD), pull a balance check, and have the ability to add and subtract credits.

I am still in the early stage of development and want to see if this is a vialble concept, if you have feedback please let me know.

I know very little about NodeJS and React so I am trying not to use them.

_front folder is an older version I wasn't sure if I was planning on keeping
